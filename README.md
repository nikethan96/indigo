# indigo

Business organizations such as restaurants and department stores face difficulties when they become overloaded with customers during certain times of the year. These situations often become chaotic, and an unpleasant experience for customers. Indigo plans to solve this problem by providing these businesses with additional employees during these times. This service provides employees who would work for few hours and gets paid by the hour. Project Indigo consists of five
members; in which I performed the role the core developer.

Technologies used: Google Firebase, Android, Node.js, CouchDB, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, and JavaScript.
Special awards: Second Runners Up â€“ AngelHack Colombo
